All of this is what my testing suggests to me, take it with a grain of salt.

Damage:
  All damage dealt seems to be randomised between 0 and some amount.

Enemy Damage:
  I assumed that it depends on the game duration... That is not true.
  Instead it only seems to be increasing with enemies killed, the formula being:
    EnemyDamage = killed ^ 2 * K1 + K2
  This makes "glass cannon" builds just bad, very sad. :[
  It also makes the battle duration vary wildly (very wildly doing what I did).

Agility:
  Dictates how much you dodge, the formula being:
    DodgeChance = Agility / (Agility + 100)
  Increases damage you deal, and it is almost 2 times as effective as Damage.

Armor:
  If the enemy attack is not dodged, one of the following happens:
    the damage is nullified, may also reduce your armor by 1
    damages the Hp, but not for the full amount
  The more armor you have the more effective it is at saving Hp.
    Seems like the relationship is linear...

Repeatability:
  It seems to me that if you choose same items,
  and set visible stats to same values (using CheatEngine for example),
  the run will behave the same.
  Except that the RNG will be different.

CheatEngine:
  For some reason, all visible values are read/written as `x * 8 + 6`.
  So in CE they will have larger values than in the game.
  Carefully calculate before writing, as the game would crash otherwise.
