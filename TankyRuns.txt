Since enemy damage is dependent on how much you killed instead of how much time passed,
  I wondered how would a (maximum defense + minimum offense) build perform.

Since Agility silently gives damage, I avoided it like a plague.
I poured atributes in Def (but I imagine Con would be equally as useless).
Iron Boots is the only sensible choice.
Since every Secondary gives damage, I must chose the least damaging one,
  at the time I assumed Agility gives little damage, so I have chosen Eletctic Dagger,
  but it seems that Agility is almost twice as effective as damage, so Battle Knife is better.

With Battle Knife I have (4 Agi, 10 Dmg) which gave me 0.318 Kills per second.
You can calculate on your own just how long these runs are,
  it will be even longer if the game slows down due to max CPU usage...

So that just leaves me with 3 slots to play with (Ring, Primary, Armor), 2 choices in each.
The 8 resulting choices are (Sorted by Hp per second):
  Harmony  Healer   Regen
  Harmony  Healer   Defend
  Defender Healer   Regen
  Defender Healer   Defend
  Harmony  Defender Regen
  Harmony  Defender Defend
  Defender Defender Regen
  Defender Defender Defend

A quick check proved that going all in Hp/Arm regen is a bad idea, so these are off the list:
  Harmony  Healer   Regen
  Defender Defender Defend
(Harmony + Defend) is always better than (Defender + Regen) so these are off the list:
  Defender Healer   Regen
  Defender Defender Regen

That leaves me with 4 choices, and I checked them all:
  Harmony  Healer   Defend
  Defender Healer   Defend
  Harmony  Defender Regen
  Harmony  Defender Defend
----------------------------------------------------------------
Def Iron Harmony  Elect  Healer   Defend = 220,687(E1)
Def Iron Defender Elect  Healer   Defend = 349,748(E2)
Def Iron Harmony  Elect  Defender Regen  = 341,531(E3)
Def Iron Harmony  Elect  Defender Defend = 230,970(E4)

I kept breaking game records (I can only assume people are not as autistic as I am about this lol)
But, while this runs were still running, I realized about the effectiveness of Agility,
  So there are even greater records.
----------------------------------------------------------------
Def Iron Harmony  Battle Healer   Defend = ?(B1)
Def Iron Defender Battle Healer   Defend = ?(B2)
Def Iron Harmony  Battle Defender Regen  = ?(B3)
Def Iron Harmony  Battle Defender Defend = ?(B4)

Since these are only one runs, better ones exist surely,
However, I am not going to waste anymore time...
  These runs took MORE THAN A MONTH!
Kinda poetic that the biggest record for the "Battleground Legends" is with "Battle Knife"
